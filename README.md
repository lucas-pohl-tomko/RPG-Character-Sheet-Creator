# sheet-app
I'm making this because i wanna make a fully customizable Cogent RPG character sheet. For now, all it does is consume the Heroku hosted API from https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api for testing purpuses! I may create my own API with Spring in the future, but for now I just wanna focus on the Vuejs part!
