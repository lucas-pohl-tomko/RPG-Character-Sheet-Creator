# sheet-app
I'm making this because i wanna make a fully customizable Cogent RPG character sheet. For now, all it does is consume the Heroku hosted API from https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api for testing purposes and display a "character sheet" (i'm trying to figure out how to make that right yet). I may create my own API with Spring in the future, but for now I just wanna focus on the Vue.js part!

## Project setup
