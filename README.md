# sheet-app
App made to display a character sheet.
I'm making this because i wanna make a fully customizable Cogent RPG character sheet. For now, all it does is consume the API from https://github.com/isalevine/friendly-character-generator-backend-api and displays a character sheet. I may create my own API with Spring in the future for the character sheet to work, but for now I just wanna focus on the Vue.js part!
